Welcome to my GitHub 😁 

I create projects that use Python, Java and other web programming technologies such as HTML, CSS and JS.

Some of the live running projects that I have done include a coffee ☕️ recommendation engine based on your tastes and a charity website; chatbot to address homelessness.

I have created quite a few projects involving AI 🤖 and also created some websites 💻.

I'm currently working on a coronavirus identification machine and also looking to build a chatbot too. 🔭 

Please feel free to take a look at some of the projects that I have made in the collection of repositories. 😄
